# The Great Obsidian Mystery: A Tutorial in Deduction

_Being a Most Instructive Account of How the Great Detective Sherlock Holmes Revolutionized His Methods of Investigation Through the Application of Modern Digital Organization_

---

## Preface: A Message from Dr. Watson

My dear readers, you find yourselves in the most fortunate position of being apprentices to the greatest consulting detective who ever lived. Through the miraculous technology of our age, you shall observe and participate in Holmes's revolutionary approach to case management—one that shall transform your own methods of organizing knowledge, whether for criminal investigation or the mundane affairs of daily life.

I have transcribed this account with meticulous care, though I confess Holmes insisted on "correcting" my observations with his own superior insights at every turn. You shall, I'm afraid, have to endure his characteristic arrogance alongside his undeniable brilliance.

A glance of the result at the end of this tutorial:

## Chapter I: The Crisis at 221B Baker Street

**[You are Dr. Watson's new assistant, learning Holmes's methods]**

"Watson!" bellowed Holmes from his study, his voice carrying that particular note of exasperation I had come to recognize as the precursor to one of his lectures. "This is intolerable! How does one expect to solve the **Case of the Vanishing Venture Capital** when one's notes are scattered like autumn leaves across Baker Street?"

I found him standing amid a chaos of papers, telegram fragments, and half-filled notebooks, his usually pristine mind palace rendered in physical form as complete disorder.

"Holmes," I ventured carefully, "perhaps we might consider a more... systematic approach?"

His grey eyes fixed upon me with that laser-like intensity that had solved a thousand mysteries. "Watson, your genius for stating the obvious never ceases to amaze me. Of course we need a system! But not just any system—we require a method worthy of minds such as ours."

He began pacing, as was his habit when a solution crystallized in that extraordinary brain. "I have discovered something called 'Obsidian'—a digital tool that promises to organize knowledge not in the pedestrian filing cabinets of ordinary minds, but as an interconnected web of deduction. We shall construct the ultimate knowledge vault!"

"But Holmes," I protested, "I've been perfectly content with Notepad++. It opens quickly, I write my notes, and—"

"And then what, Watson?" Holmes interrupted with characteristic disdain. "You create files named 'new-73' and 'meeting-notes-final-FINAL-v2', never to locate them again? How delightfully... ordinary."

_[Dear reader, you are about to witness Holmes teach both Watson and yourself the superior methods of knowledge organization. Do try to keep up.]_

---

## Chapter II: In Which Holmes Establishes His Digital Dominion

### The Foundation of Genius

_(1. Creating the Vault)_

"Watson," Holmes announced, settling into his chair with the satisfaction of a man about to deliver a masterpiece, "the first principle of superior detection is proper organization. We shall begin by creating what these modern innovators call a 'vault.'"

_[Follow along, dear reader—Holmes insists you practice as he instructs]_

"Download this 'Obsidian' application," he commanded, waving dismissively at his laptop. "Choose 'Manage vaults...' and create a new folder. This shall be the digital equivalent of 221B Baker Street—the command center of our operations."

![[Pasted image 20250921111257.png]]

"Now, Watson, observe the elegance of the markdown format—far superior to your crude text files. The basic syntax even you should master:

1. **Headings**: Write `# My Brilliant Deduction` for main points, `## Supporting Evidence` for details
2. **Text Formatting**: `**Indisputable fact** *mere speculation*`
3. **Horizontal Line**: Three dashes `---` to separate thoughts
4. **External Links**: `[Scotland Yard Records](https://yard.gov.uk)`
5. **Internal Links**: Here, Watson, is where brilliance distinguishes itself from mediocrity. Write `[[Moriarty]]` and behold—a link that can exist even before the referenced note! The mind of genius anticipates connections others cannot see. I dare you also to try writing `[[Moriarty|My eternal rival]]` and see what happens.

### The Web of Knowledge

_(Links and Backlinks)_

"Create a link by writing `[[Obsidian]]` in your welcome note," Holmes instructed with the patience of a master training a particularly slow pupil. "Click it, and witness—the note materializes! This is how truly superior minds navigate knowledge."

_[Try this yourself—create the link and click it]_

"But observe, Watson—" Holmes pointed to the bottom-right corner with the flourish of a magician revealing his trick, "One backlink! Click it!"

![[Pasted image 20250921114953.png]]

"This, my dear fellow, is how we trace the web of deduction backwards. Every fact connected, every connection visible. It's almost as if they designed this tool specifically for minds like mine."

---

## Chapter III: The Architecture of Brilliance

### The DATA Framework

_(2. Basic folder structure)_

Holmes stepped to his blackboard with characteristic authority. "Lesser minds organize randomly. The superior intellect follows what I call the DATA framework:

**`1 Delivery`** - Our active cases and completed investigations. The meat of our work.

**`2 Assets`** - The building blocks of knowledge: people, concepts, evidence. Think of these as your reference library, Watson.

**`3 Timeline`** - For those moments when chronology matters more than logical connection. Daily observations, monthly reviews.

**`4 Arsenal`** - The tools of our trade. Templates, configurations, images. Purely utilitarian."

"This structure," Holmes continued with evident satisfaction, "serves both personal investigation and professional consultation. Though naturally, those of ordinary intellect might require separate vaults to prevent confusion."

_[Create these folders now—right-click in the explorer, select 'new folder', and name them exactly as Holmes specified. The numbers ensure proper ordering.]_

![[Pasted image 20250921115228.png]]

"The highest complexity I recommend—and I do not make recommendations lightly—appears thus:"

```markdown
📁 Holmes-Vault/
├── 📁 1 Delivery/
│   ├── 📁 Active/
│   │   └── 📁 Vanishing-Venture-Capital/

## Chapter IV: The Dramatis Personae

### Cataloguing the Players

_(3. Sherlock Holmes' Vault)_

"Every investigation begins with proper documentation of the principals involved," Holmes declared. "We shall start with the most important subject—myself."

_[Create a new note under `2 Assets`]_

"Name it 'Sherlock Holmes'—the first line becomes the title, naturally. Then observe this elegant feature..."

_[Type `---` on a new line and watch the properties panel appear]_

![[Pasted image 20250921144100.png]]

"Properties, Watson! Metadata that even your limited organizational skills can appreciate. Now, follow my example precisely:"

```markdown

---
The world's only consulting detective. When the police are out of their depth—which is to say, always—they come to me.
```

"But Holmes," Watson interjected with uncharacteristic boldness, "what if that online image disappears? Surely a local image would be more reliable?"

Holmes raised an eyebrow. "Watson! For once, your paranoia serves a useful purpose. Observe the superior method."

_[Create a copy of Sherlock's note by right-clicking it, name it 'Dr. John H. Watson']_

_[Copy this image in your clipboard and past it into the note, found in images/watson-profile.png]:_

![[watson-profile.png]]

_[Name it `watson-profile.png` and modify the note]:_

```markdown

---
My steadfast companion and chronicler. Somewhat limited in deductive capacity, but possesses admirable loyalty and a gift for stating the obvious.
```

"Now, Watson—and pay attention—create a subfolder called 'images' under `4 Arsenal` and drag the image there."

"But Holmes! Won't that break all my references?"

Holmes smiled with insufferable smugness. "Check your note, dear fellow."

_[Watson discovers the link still works—Obsidian automatically maintains references]_

"The application is nearly as clever as I am, Watson. But we can make it even more efficient. Observe..."

_[Go to Settings > Files and links > Default location for new attachments, select 'In the folder specified below', enter `4 Arsenal/images`]_

![[Pasted image 20250921151535.png]]

"Now any image you paste will automatically be filed correctly. Organization without effort—though of course, such convenience could never replace genuine intelligence."

---

## Chapter V: The Art of Automation

### Templates for the Methodical Mind

"Watson," Holmes began, "I observe you creating each new contact manually. How... tedious. Allow me to demonstrate the superior approach."

_[Go to Settings > Community plugins, enable community plugins, search for and install 'Templater']_

![[Pasted image 20250921173320.png]]

"Create a directory 'templates' under `4 Arsenal`, then a note called 'People' with this content:"

```markdown
<%* 
const personName = await tp.system.prompt("Enter person's name");
const imageName = await tp.system.prompt("Enter image filename (e.g., watson.png)");
%>---
tags:
  - People
created: <% tp.file.creation_date("YYYY-MM-DD") %>
image: <% imageName %>
---

---

## <% personName %>

---

![[<% imageName %>]]

---

## Notes

---

<%* 
await tp.file.rename(personName);
await tp.file.move("/2 Assets/People/" + personName);
%>
```

"The template asks for input, fills in the details, and files everything correctly. Efficiency, Watson—the hallmark of superior method."

_[Configure Templater: Settings > Templater > Template folder location: `4 Arsenal/templates`]_

_[Set up hotkey: Settings > Templater > Template hotkeys, add People.md, then Settings > Hotkeys, bind 'Templater: Create People' to `Ctrl+Shift+P`]_

[You should end up with the following structure. If not, adapt accordingly.]
![[Pasted image 20250921180850.png]]
### The Case Begins

_(Creating our first delivery)_

"Now, Watson, for our current case. I require a template that creates a complete case structure automatically."

_[Create a 'Delivery' template]:_

```markdown
<%* 
const deliveryName = await tp.system.prompt("Enter case name");
const priority = await tp.system.prompt("Enter priority (High/Medium/Low)", "Medium");
%>---
tags:
  - Delivery
  - <% deliveryName.replace(/\s+/g, '-') %>
created: <% tp.file.creation_date("YYYY-MM-DD") %>
status: Under Investigation
priority: <% priority %>
case_name: <% deliveryName %>
---

%>
```

_[Bind this to `Ctrl+Shift+D`]_

"Test it, Watson. Create our case: 'Vanishing Venture Capital' with priority 'High'."

### Meeting Documentation

_(The consulting process)_

"For our client interviews and case meetings, we require systematic documentation. Create `Meeting` note in `4 Arsenal/templates`:"

```markdown
<%*
const projectNames = [... new Set(app.vault.getMarkdownFiles().map(f => f.path).filter(path => path.startsWith("1 Delivery")).map(path => path.split("/")[1]))].filter(name => !name.endsWith(".md"));
const projectName = (await tp.system.suggester((item) => item, projectNames, true, "Select Case"));
const chosenDate = await tp.system.prompt("Meeting date:", tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD"));
const meetingType = await tp.system.prompt("Meeting type (e.g., Client Interview, Evidence Review, Team Briefing)");
%>---
case: '[[<% projectName %>]]'
date: '[[<% chosenDate %>]]'
attendees:
  - "[[Sherlock Holmes]]"
  - "[[Dr. John H. Watson]]"
type: <% meetingType %>
tags:

- [ ]

<%* 
await tp.file.rename(chosenDate + " " + meetingType);
await tp.file.move("/1 Delivery/" + projectName + "/Meetings/" + chosenDate + " " + meetingType);
%>
```

_[Bind to `Ctrl+Shift+M` and create a "Client Interview" meeting]_

"Add our client—Mr. Reginald Pumpernickel—to the attendees using `[[Reginald Pumpernickel]]`."

_[Use the People template to create Reginald's profile—use the provided image. Then drag both Sherlock and Watson in People folder.]_

![[reginald.png]]

## Chapter VI: The Daily Chronicle

### Observational Records

_(Daily notes and journals integration)_

"Watson, even the most extraordinary mind benefits from daily reflection. Create this simple template named `Daily` (change ' in \`):"

```markdown

'''calendar-nav
'''

## Today's Investigations
- [ ]

## Observations
- 

## Deductions in Progress
- ```
And for our `Monthly` review:
```markdown

'''calendar-nav
'''

'''calendar-timeline
mode: week
'''
## Overall review
- [ ]

```

[Create two subfolders in 3 Timeline: Daily and Monthly]

_[Install the `Journals` plugin, configure it to use this Daily template]_

![[Pasted image 20250921202516.png]]
[Configure it. Go to options > Journals, create one called "Daily" and another one called "Monthly" with the desired time intervals. Customize it using your locale and link it to the templates we just created. Also link where these notes should be created: 3 Timeline/Daily and 3 Timeline/monthly]

_[Open Calendar view of Journals plugin by expending right sidebar, dock it at the bottom, click today's date. You can also drag the graph view on top]_

![[Pasted image 20250922161919.png]]

---

## Chapter VII: The Web of Deduction

### Visualizing Connections

_(Graph view and organization)_

"Behold, Watson—the web of our investigation made visible!"

_[Open Graph view, but first configure it properly]_

"Currently, this resembles your filing system—chaotic and unhelpful. We shall remedy this."

_[Settings > Graph view > Groups, add color coding]:_

- Delivery: Red
- Assets: Yellow
- Timeline: Green


_[Settings > Files and links > Excluded files > Manage, filter out `4 Arsenal`. Then click on the red button Rebuild]_

![[Pasted image 20250922162125.png]]

"Now we see only what matters—the connections between cases, people, and evidence. Observe how Mr. Pumpernickel connects to our case, how our meetings link to our investigation. This is deduction made visible!"

---

## Chapter VIII: The Aesthetic of Excellence

### Befitting Appearance for Superior Minds

_(Themes and visual enhancements)_

"Watson, a disorganized appearance reflects a disorganized mind. Our digital Baker Street must inspire confidence in our clients and efficiency in our methods."

_[Settings > Appearance > Themes > Manage, install 'Obsidianite']_

_[Install 'Iconize' plugin, download FontAwesome icons, right-click folders to add icons]:_

- 1 Delivery: Star
- 2 Assets: Gem
- 3 Timeline: Calendar
- 4 Arsenal: Toolbox

_[Install 'File Color' plugin, create Red, Yellow and Green color and select 'apply cascade'. Apply colors matching your graph view]_

![[Pasted image 20250922162720.png]]

### Enhanced Documentation

_(Callouts and formatting)_

"In our client interview, Watson, you noted Mr. Pumpernickel's suspicious behavior. Present it properly:"

Instead of: `Warning, Sir Pumpernickel looked too much angry`

Use this superior format:

```markdown
> [!warning] Suspicious Behavior
> Client displayed excessive anger during interview—performance suggests deception rather than genuine distress.
```

![[Pasted image 20250922162905.png]]

"Now our observations carry the weight they deserve."

---

## Chapter IX: The Intelligence Network

### Creating Our Database of Knowledge

"Watson," Holmes declared, settling into his favorite armchair with the air of a professor about to deliver his most brilliant lecture, "we have mastered the art of case management, but true detective work requires a comprehensive intelligence network. Every criminal, every witness, every piece of evidence must be catalogued and instantly accessible."

He gestured toward the laptop with characteristic flourish. "Observe how we shall transform our scattered assets into a proper database worthy of Scotland Yard—if they possessed half our intelligence."

"Holmes," Watson interjected with growing confidence, "surely we don't need such complexity for simple note-taking?"

"Simple note-taking?" Holmes's eyebrows shot up in theatrical horror. "My dear Watson, we are not maiden aunts recording tea party gossip! We are consulting detectives dealing with the criminal element of London. Every detail matters, every connection reveals truth, every pattern exposes deception."

He stood and began his familiar pacing. "Today I shall demonstrate the power of what these modern innovators call 'bases'—a system for organizing knowledge that would make even Mycroft's government files appear amateurish by comparison."

### The Personnel Registry

"Click on the left sidebar, Watson—that innocent-looking icon shall unleash organizational power beyond your current comprehension."

_[Create a folder 'bases' in '4 Arsenal']_

_[Create a base by clicking on the left part and drag it into the bases folder]:_

![[Pasted image 20250922084103.png]]

"Now, create what we shall call our 'People' base. This will serve as our complete registry of every individual connected to our investigations—suspects, witnesses, clients, even the occasional competent police officer, should we ever encounter one."

_[Call it `People`.]_

"Excellent! Now observe this crucial step—we must filter this base to show only our personnel files. Click 'Filter' and add the condition 'where file tags contains People'."

![[Pasted image 20250922163029.png]]

Holmes nodded approvingly. "Already you can see the elegance—every person we've documented appears in a clean, organized list. But we can do better. Create a new 'View':"

![[Pasted image 20250922084313.png]]

"Configure it for a gallery display that will give us a visual directory of all persons of interest."

![[Pasted image 20250922084510.png]]

"Magnificent! Observe the result—we now have a proper intelligence gallery:"

![[Pasted image 20250922084531.png]]

"But here, Watson, is where true genius manifests itself."

### Dynamic Intelligence Gathering

Holmes rubbed his hands together with evident satisfaction. "Add another view by copying from the last one—call it 'In File'—with a specific filter condition by clicking on 'advanced filter':"

![[Pasted image 20250922084656.png]]

"Configure it with this advanced filter condition: `this.file.hasLink(file)`."

"But Holmes," Watson protested, examining the empty view, "it shows nothing!"

"Patience, my dear fellow. Genius reveals itself to those who wait." Holmes opened their recent client interview note. "Add this line: `![[People.base#In File]]`"

Watson typed the addition, and suddenly the magic revealed itself.

"Now if you remove Watson from the people attribute, it will automatically render a new view:"

![[Pasted image 20250922084927.png]]

"Extraordinary!" Watson exclaimed. "It automatically shows only the people mentioned in this particular document!"

"Precisely," Holmes replied with insufferable smugness. "This, Watson, is how superior minds work—the system anticipates our needs and adapts accordingly. Every meeting now displays its relevant personnel automatically, every case shows its key players, every investigation reveals its network of connections without manual effort."

---

## Chapter X: The Web of All Knowledge

### Expanding Our Intelligence Network

"Now, Watson," Holmes continued, settling back into his chair with the satisfaction of a master craftsman admiring his work, "we have created an efficient system for our internal investigations. But true detective work requires intelligence from the wider world—newspaper articles, public records, background information on companies and organizations."

He gestured toward Watson's computer with characteristic impatience. "Open that primitive device you call a web browser and install the 'Obsidian Clipper' extension. Yes, Watson, even your limited technical skills should suffice for this task."

"Configure it to save content directly to our `2 Assets` folder," Holmes instructed, watching Watson fumble with the settings. "This shall serve as our automatic filing system for external intelligence."

![[Pasted image 20250922085650.png]]

"Now, navigate to this Wikipedia page about fictional companies—an amusing irony, given that our current case involves what appears to be an entirely fictitious venture capital firm."

_Browse [Fictional Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_company)_

"Use the clipper extension—that innocuous little icon that now appears in your browser. Watch as it automatically creates a properly formatted note in our vault, complete with tags and proper filing."

![[Pasted image 20250922163413.png]]

Holmes leaned back with evident pleasure. "Observe, Watson—the article has been captured, formatted, and filed without any manual effort on our part. The source is preserved, the content is searchable, and the information is now part of our investigation network."

"This is quite remarkable, Holmes," Watson admitted. "I can see how this would be invaluable for research."

"Naturally you can, Watson. Even minds of limited capacity can recognize efficiency when it's properly demonstrated. But consider the broader implications—every relevant article, every background document, every piece of contextual information can now be captured and integrated into our cases with a single click."

---

## Chapter XI: The Chronicles of Daily Detection

### Automated Monthly Summaries

"Watson," Holmes announced several days later, examining the collection of daily notes they had accumulated, "I observe you've been diligently maintaining your daily chronicles as instructed. Most commendable, though the content lacks the penetrating insight one might hope for."

_[Create 2 other dailies within the same month as your first one. Ask your favorite LLM to generate moderate-size content for Sherlock's daily writing for each day.]_

Watson had indeed created several daily notes, each documenting the progress of their various investigations with moderate detail and occasional flashes of genuine observation.

"However," Holmes continued, "the truly superior detective does not merely accumulate daily observations—he synthesizes them into patterns, trends, and actionable intelligence. Today, I shall demonstrate how modern technology can amplify even your limited analytical capabilities."

Holmes began configuring his system with characteristic precision. "First, we shall establish proper connectivity between our vault and the outside world of artificial intelligence."

_[Now Sherlock will demonstrate how to summarize all daily notes of the month into a monthly note using MCP and Claude Desktop]:_

1. "Download and install Claude Desktop, Watson—even you should manage this simple task."
    
2. "Install the 'Local REST API' plugin in our Obsidian vault."
    
3. "Install the 'MCP Tools' plugin and click on 'install server':"
    

![[Pasted image 20250922105006.png]]

4. "Open Claude Desktop and verify the Obsidian MCP server is recognized:"

![[Pasted image 20250922105100.png]]

5. "If the connection fails, restart that primitive machine of yours. Otherwise, configure the permissions to allow read-only operations—I wouldn't trust even advanced artificial intelligence with full write access to our carefully organized vault."
    
6. "Now observe, Watson, as I demonstrate the proper way to instruct an artificial intelligence."
    

Holmes typed with characteristic confidence: "Summarize all my daily notes of September 2025 into a monthly note by complementing the existing monthly note of September 2025 (ie answer in this chat in Markdown format). Write it as an artifact."

Within moments, Claude had processed every daily entry, identified key patterns, highlighted significant developments in their cases, and created a comprehensive monthly overview.

"Remarkable!" Watson exclaimed. "It's identified connections between cases that I hadn't even noticed!"

"Naturally, Watson. While artificial intelligence cannot match human genius—particularly mine—it excels at processing large volumes of data and identifying patterns that might escape less observant minds. It serves as an excellent assistant for those who lack the natural deductive capabilities of a consulting detective."

7. "Paste the generated summary into your monthly note and adapt it accordingly—though naturally, my superior editing will be required to achieve true excellence."

_[Now create two subfolders in '1 Delivery': 'Active' and 'Archive'. Move the full folder 'Vanishing Venture Capital into Archive. Well done in solving this case!]_

---

## Chapter XII: The Final Deduction

### Advanced Techniques for the Ambitious Detective

"Before we conclude our tutorial, Watson," Holmes said, organizing his papers with characteristic precision, "I should mention several additional tools that might prove useful as your skills develop—though naturally, they cannot substitute for genuine intellectual capability."

He counted on his fingers with professorial authority. "For those who require a simplified structure than our excellent template system provides, the 'Calendar' plugin offers simplified calendar integration. See Journals as as nice merge between Calendar, Daily notes and Periodic Notes, with an embedded integration with Templater!" 

"The 'Excalidraw' plugin proves invaluable for those who think visually—crime scene diagrams, relationship maps, evidence flow charts. Though of course, minds like mine require no such aids to visualization."

"'Kanban' boards appeal to those who prefer task management in columns—rather like organizing playing cards, Watson, which should suit your methodical but unimaginative approach to problem-solving."

Holmes paused, fixing Watson with that familiar penetrating stare. "But remember, my dear fellow—the most important principle of superior detection remains unchanged: the tool serves the mind, not the reverse. No plugin, no matter how sophisticated, can compensate for lack of observational skill or logical reasoning."

"I've learned that lesson well, Holmes," Watson replied with growing confidence. "This system has indeed transformed my approach to investigation."

"Good," Holmes replied with uncharacteristic approval. "Then perhaps there is hope for you yet, Watson. Though you shall never achieve my level of deductive brilliance, you may at least avoid the grosser errors of incompetence that plague lesser minds."

He gestured grandly at their now-organized vault. "We have created more than a filing system, Watson—we have constructed a machine for thinking, a framework for genius, a digital extension of the detective mind itself. Use it well."

---

## Final Inspector's Notes

_[A brief addendum from the practical Dr. Watson]_

_Dear readers, having now worked with Holmes's system for several months, I can confirm its effectiveness despite his characteristic boasting. The organized approach has indeed revolutionized our practice, making complex investigations manageable and ensuring no crucial detail is overlooked._

_For those inspired to create their own detective vault, remember that the system grows with use. Start simple, add complexity only as needed, and always prioritize function over form. Holmes may claim supernatural powers of deduction, but the truth is simpler: good organization makes everyone appear more intelligent._

_The methods described here adapt well beyond criminal investigation. Whether you're a researcher, consultant, writer, or simply someone who values clear thinking and systematic approach, these principles will serve you well._

_Remember: the game is afoot, but now you're properly equipped to play._

_—Dr. John H. Watson, M.D._
