# The Great Obsidian Mystery: A Tutorial in Deduction

_Being a Most Instructive Account of How the Great Detective Sherlock Holmes Revolutionized His Methods of Investigation Through the Application of Modern Digital Organization_

---

## Preface: A Message from Dr. Watson

My dear readers, you find yourselves in the most fortunate position of being apprentices to the greatest consulting detective who ever lived. Through the miraculous technology of our age, you shall observe and participate in Holmes's revolutionary approach to case management—one that shall transform your own methods of organizing knowledge, whether for criminal investigation or the mundane affairs of daily life.

I have transcribed this account with meticulous care, though I confess Holmes insisted on "correcting" my observations with his own superior insights at every turn. You shall, I'm afraid, have to endure his characteristic arrogance alongside his undeniable brilliance.
