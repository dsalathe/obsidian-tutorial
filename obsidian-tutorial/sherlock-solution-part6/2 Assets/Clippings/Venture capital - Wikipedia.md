**Venture capital** (**VC**) is a form of [private equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_equity "Private equity") financing provided by firms or [funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funds "Funds") to [startup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start-up_company "Start-up company"), early-stage, and emerging companies, that have been deemed to have high growth potential or that have demonstrated high growth in terms of number of employees, annual revenue, scale of operations, etc. Venture capital firms or funds invest in these early-stage companies in exchange for [equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_\(finance\) "Equity (finance)"), or an ownership stake. Venture capitalists take on the risk of [financing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financing "Financing") start-ups in the hopes that some of the companies they support will become successful. Because [startups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company "Startup company") face high uncertainty,<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>1<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> VC investments have high rates of failure. Start-ups are usually based on an [innovative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation "Innovation") technology or [business model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model "Business model") and often come from [high technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_technology "High technology") industries such as [information technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology "Information technology") (IT) or [biotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology "Biotechnology").

This initial capital injection is crucial for startups to kickstart their journey and attract further investment in subsequent funding rounds.
