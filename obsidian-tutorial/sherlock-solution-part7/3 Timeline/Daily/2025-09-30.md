## Today's Investigations

- [x] Deep dive into Marcus Blackwood's background
- [x] Analyze metadata from financial documents
- [x] Review insurance policy details
- [ ] Prepare evidence presentation for confrontation

## Observations

Watson made coffee this morning—remarkable only because he somehow managed to brew it at precisely the strength I prefer without asking. Perhaps my systematic approach is finally influencing his thinking patterns.

The [[Marcus Blackwood]] investigation yielded fascinating results. His connection to [[Reginald Pumpernickel]] stretches back six months before the supposed investment. Phone records (legally obtained through our banking contacts) show 47 calls between them during this "pre-relationship" period.

> [!success] Breakthrough Pattern Insurance policy purchased three weeks before "investment" with specific fraud coverage. The timing is too convenient to be coincidental.

Spent two hours this afternoon updating our [[People]] base with the new information. The dynamic filtering immediately revealed three other individuals connected to both Pumpernickel and Blackwood—all with similar "investment fraud" claims in their histories.

Watson reviewed my notes and said, "Holmes, this looks like a professional operation." Finally, the obvious becomes clear even to him.

## Deductions in Progress

The beauty of our systematic approach reveals itself: what seemed like isolated observations now form a clear pattern. The [[Vanishing Venture Capital]] case isn't about venture capital at all—it's insurance fraud with us as the unwitting documentation service.

- Pre-existing relationship: Established
- Financial pattern: Deliberate rather than chaotic
- Insurance timing: Suspiciously precise
- Our role: Legitimate-looking investigation to support fraud claim

Need to structure tomorrow's confrontation carefully. Our professional documentation must be irrefutable.

The local graph view for [[Reginald Pumpernickel]] now shows the complete web—every connection we've documented, every meeting recorded, every piece of evidence catalogued. Visual proof of systematic deception.
