## Today's Investigations

- [x] Review bank transaction records from Swiss Account 1234
- [x] Cross-reference Pumpernickel's timeline with public records
- [ ] Schedule follow-up with Marcus Blackwood

## Observations

This morning's review of the financial documents revealed something peculiar. The timestamps on several transfers don't align with [[Reginald Pumpernickel]]'s stated timeline. He claims the fraud occurred on [[2025-09-08]], but preliminary analysis shows activity patterns suggesting familiarity with the account structure weeks earlier.

> [!warning] Timeline Discrepancy Client demonstrated detailed knowledge of internal company operations during our [[2025-09-22 Client Interview]]. How would a defrauded investor possess such specific operational insights?

Watson suggested I was being overly suspiciousâ€”his exact words were "sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, Holmes." But in my experience, when someone knows too much, there's usually a reason.

The [[Swiss Account 1234]] transaction logs show regular patterns, then sudden changes. Need to map these against company formation dates.

## Deductions in Progress

- Connection between [[Marcus Blackwood]] and [[Reginald Pumpernickel]] predates claimed business relationship
- Financial literacy level inconsistent with "naive investor" persona
- Emotional responses during interview felt rehearsed rather than genuine

The graph view is proving invaluable for visualizing these connections. Each new link reveals another layer of the relationship web.
