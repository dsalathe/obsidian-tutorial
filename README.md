# Obsidian Tutorial and Template

Welcome to my minimalist Obsidian template project!

## Structure

Follow obsidian-tutorial at [The Blog - Part 1](https://dsalathe.github.io/blog/#/blog/15).

Partial results are in subfolders of `obsidian-tutorial`.

You can directly use the `obisdian-template` for a more productive-ready template.

## Motivation

Many people just take note using Notepad++ because it is quick to open and quick to start writing. But what about finding back what you wrote? I already witnessed people opening their `new - 131` file in Notepad++ and I bet they struggle finding where they wrote what.

Once I started working on multiple different projects with multiple different deadlines with multiple different teams I quickly realized Notepad++ won't do it anymore. I then started to look for more advanced tools. There are many, but a lot of them trade off the advantage of Notepad++ to have the quickest time-to-be-ready to take notes to effectively propose solutions to sort them nicely. And all of them shared the same flaw: when organizing your files, you follow the very-well-know file-structure of computers: everything is ordered in folders and subfolders. While it is a very natural way of ordering your thoughts, it forces you to use one dimension to sort them. Let me explain: You probably want to order your thoughts into different projects, let say, `Ninja WebApps` and `Startup Radar`. But for both of them, you want to split your notes between `Meetings` and `Documentation`. The first problem is that you will probably have to duplicate your subfolders twice, like that:

- Ninja WebApps
  - Meetings
  - Documentations
- Startup Radar
  - Meetings
  - Documentations

More than that, here it looks logical in which order you want to dive into the dimensions: first project-like and then kind-of-note-like. But sometimes it is unclear and you might not be consistent within each project. Finally, what if you want to actually have a view based on the time instead? Should you create a folder each day and then arrange folders as above? You got it, today's structure is based on one dimension at a time, and it can limit the power of indexing your files in a smarter way.

Obsidian breaks this thinking by having a very convenient `link-oriented` way to organize your notes, while still letting you keeping a folder-file structure if it can re-assure you. Also, Obsidian have tons of tools to help you write something very quickly and classify it very quickly as well, but the trade-off here is that it can be harder to master the tool as it would be with Notepad++.
