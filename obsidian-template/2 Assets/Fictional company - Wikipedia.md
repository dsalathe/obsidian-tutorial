**Fictional companies** are often used in [film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film "Film"), [television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television "Television"), [video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game "Video game"), [books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book "Book") and [comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics "Comics") where [copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright "Copyright") or the likely chance of being prosecuted exists from using the name of a real company. They may be used on television in countries where the use of real company names or trademarks is prohibited in dramatic presentations to avoid the possibility of [product placement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_placement "Product placement"). An example of a generic fictional company is the [Acme Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_Corporation "Acme Corporation").

Often, when a fictional company is used, it will be a [parody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody "Parody") of a real world counterpart, which would avoid any unwanted legal issues.[^1] [^2]

In other cases, fictional brands have been carried across multiple series and even from movies to TV. [Oceanic Airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_Airlines "Oceanic Airlines") first appeared in the 1965 two-parter episode " [The Ditching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ditching "The Ditching") " of the television series *[Flipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipper_\(1964_TV_series\) "Flipper (1964 TV series)")*, and has been seen in multiple series and films since including the 1996 film *[Executive Decision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Decision "Executive Decision")* and the 2004–2010 television series *[Lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_\(2004_TV_series\) "Lost (2004 TV series)")*.[^3]
