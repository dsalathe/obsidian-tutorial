## Today's tasks
## Today's Investigations

- [x]  Interview Mrs. Pemberton about suspicious activities at the bank
- [x]  Examine the mysterious telegram from [[Reginald Pumpernickel]]
- [ ]  Research connections between Pumpernickel Industries and offshore accounts
- [x]  Review financial documents seized from the Threadneedle Street office
- [ ]  Follow up with Inspector Lestrade about the missing portfolio manager

## Observations

### Morning Consultation (9:30 AM)

- [[Mrs. Pemberton]] arrived precisely on time—unusual for someone claiming distress
- Her hands showed no signs of recent financial anxiety (well-manicured, expensive rings still worn)
- Kept checking her timepiece every few minutes—expecting someone?
- Mentioned seeing [[Reginald Pumpernickel]] at the bank on Tuesday, but bank records show he was supposedly in Edinburgh

### Document Analysis (11:00 AM - 2:00 PM)

- The Threadneedle Street papers reveal a pattern: all major transfers occurred on Thursdays
- Signature analysis shows three distinct handwriting styles on documents attributed to the same person
- Most intriguing: invoice from "Continental Consulting Services"—a company that doesn't appear in any registry
- Watson noted the paper quality differs between "genuine" and suspicious documents

### Afternoon Telegram Examination (3:00 PM)

- Telegram from [[Reginald Pumpernickel]] uses peculiar phrasing: "FUNDS RELOCATED TEMPORARILY STOP EXPECT RESOLUTION SHORTLY STOP"
- "RELOCATED" not "STOLEN" or "MISSING"—suggests deliberate movement rather than theft
- Telegram sent from Charing Cross station, but Pumpernickel claims to have been at his country estate all week

## Deductions in Progress

### The Pumpernickel Paradox

Evidence increasingly suggests our client is orchestrating his own financial "disappearance":

- Contradictory location testimonies (Edinburgh vs London vs Country Estate)
- Calm demeanor inconsistent with genuine loss of fortune
- Technical knowledge of offshore banking revealed in casual conversation
- Connection to mysterious Continental Consulting Services

### The Thursday Pattern

All significant financial movements occurred on Thursdays—the day Mrs. Pemberton visits her sister in Brighton. Convenient absence of key witness, or calculated timing?

### Next Logical Steps

- [ ]  Investigate Continental Consulting Services through European contacts
- [ ]  Surveillance of Pumpernickel's actual whereabouts this Thursday
- [ ]  Cross-reference Mrs. Pemberton's Brighton visits with financial transaction dates

## Personal Notes

Watson's observation skills continue to improve marginally. His notice of the paper quality differences shows promise, though he failed to deduce the obvious implications.

The case grows more intriguing by the hour—Pumpernickel may have created the perfect crime: stealing from himself to defraud insurance companies while maintaining social standing. Brilliant in its simplicity, though naturally not brilliant enough to fool me.

Weather: Foggy morning cleared to brilliant sunshine—appropriate for a day of illuminating revelations.
